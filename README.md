# simple-spring-boot-mail
Sending an email with Spring boot.

For the mail server properties to work, your gmail password must be correct and available for a third party app/service to use. For security I used a google app password. The instructions to set one up is here: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en (select custom app in the dropdown). You would use that 16-digit passcode in application.properties .
